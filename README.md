# Rate-distortion optimization guided autoencoder for isometric embedding in Euclidean latent space
This repository provides part of source files for the baseline model, dataset, and implementation guide for our method for the above paper submitted to ICML2020 and experiments therein.  
Now, we are preparing to publish matrials.  
It will be available by the begining of the ICML 2020 conference.
